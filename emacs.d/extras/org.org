#+title: Org Timetracking – Quick Start (Today)
#+author: Anna
#+startup: overview

* Goal
You want to time track like this (searchable, editable, Notepad++-style):

- 08:00-08:20: KUNDE
  Meeting zur Absprache Webshop mit mg
  Ticket: JIRA-1234

Your config provides an Org Capture template = *tl* that automatically writes into a monthly file:

~/Documents/org/work-YYYY-MM.org

and files entries under today’s date (datetree).

* 0) One-time check (takes 30 seconds)
1. Make sure your updated =org.el= is loaded (restart Emacs or evaluate the file).
2. Press: =C-c c=
3. Confirm you see a capture option:
   - =tl= :: Time log (monthly, multiline)

If you don’t see it, your config wasn’t loaded or there’s an error in the init sequence.

* 1) Create your first timelog entry (right now)
1. Press: =C-c c=
2. Choose: =tl=
3. Fill the prompts:
   - *From*: e.g. =08:00=
   - *To*: e.g. =08:20=
   - *Context*: e.g. =KUNDE= or company name or =misc=
4. You land in the description line (indented). Type what you did, e.g.:
   - =Meeting zur Absprache Webshop mit mg=
5. *Ticket (optional)*:
   - enter e.g. =JIRA-1234= or =GDI-...=
   - or leave blank
6. Save capture: =C-c C-c=

Result (example):

- 08:00-08:20: KUNDE
  Meeting zur Absprache Webshop mit mg
  Ticket: JIRA-1234

* 2) Add entries throughout the day (the habit)
Every time you switch tasks or finish a chunk of work:

- =C-c c tl= → fill times/context → type description → =C-c C-c=

If you’re in a hurry or things overlap:
- write a rough entry quickly
- correct the times later (it’s plain text)

* 3) Where your entries end up
They go to the current month file:

~/Documents/org/work-YYYY-MM.org

and are filed under today’s date heading (datetree), e.g.:

* 2026-02-18 Tue
- 08:00-08:20: KUNDE
  ...

* 4) Editing / fixing overlaps
Open the current month file and just edit the text.

Useful list-item editing in Org:
- =M-RET=        create a new list item
- =M-up/down=    move the current list item up/down
- =M-left/right= change indentation level

* 5) Searching your history
**Search across all monthly logs (recommended)**
- =C-c a s=
- type a search term (company name, =KUNDE=, =JIRA-1234=, a person, etc.)

**Search within the current month file**
- =C-s= to search forward
- =C-M-s= for regexp search (handy for time patterns)

* 6) Suggested lightweight routine (works well in practice)
**Morning**
- Start logging from the first meaningful work block.

**During the day**
- Log whenever you switch context or finish a task chunk.

**End of day (2 minutes)**
- Quick scan of today’s section:
  - fix overlapping times if needed
  - ensure important items have a searchable keyword (company, project, ticket)

* Notes / Tips
- Consistency helps: if you always use the same company spelling and ticket format, searching later is effortless.
- You don’t need perfect structure. The datetree + consistent lines are already a huge win over scattered files.
